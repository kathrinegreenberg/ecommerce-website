	<p>Rings & Things was established in January 2014. Being a new company, we are in the process of growing. We began with a small inventory of only a few of each product in stock but are quickly expanding. Our staff is also expanding quickly! It started with two founders, just looking for a hobby in their spare time, and turned into a company with 20 employees. We are located in Ottawa near Algonquin College.</p>

	<p>Rings & Things has big plans for the future! We are in the process of upgrading to a larger office for our growing team. We are also looking to expand our site to bracelets and hopefully hair accessories. Once the full line is set up on our website, Rings & Things will be opening a boutique in Ottawa. By the end of 2016 we hope to have doubled our staff as well as our business.</p>
